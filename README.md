# Facial Recognition Project

This is a project to train a neural network to recognize faces on a cropped version of the UMIST faces dataset. It contains a test file where multiple dimensionality reduction, clustering techniques and models are tested on the data to come up with a final pipeline for training a classifier. The full report can also be found in the repo.
